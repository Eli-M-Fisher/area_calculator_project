# Area Shape Resolver Calculator

A simple object-oriented Python project for calculating the area and perimeter of basic 2D geometric shapes.

## Supported Shapes
- Rectangle
- Square
- Triangle
- Circle
- Regular Hexagon

## Features
- Clean modular structure using OOP principles
- Abstract base class (`Shape`)
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Input validation and exception handling
- CLI interface (text-based)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `main.py` from your terminal:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output
```
=== Area Shape Resolver Calculator ===
Available shapes: rectangle, square, triangle, circle, hexagon
Enter the shape type: circle
Enter radius: 5

Result:
Circle (Area: 78.54, Perimeter: 31.42)
```
